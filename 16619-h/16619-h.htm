<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

  <p>"The public will not stand for increased railway fares," says a
  contemporary. They have had too much standing at the old prices.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A Mile End man writes to <i>The Daily Express</i> to say that one of
  his ducks laid four eggs in one day. It seems about the most sensible
  thing the bird could have done with them.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>As a result of the recent Tube extension, passengers can now travel
  from the Bank to Ealing in thirty-five minutes. It is further claimed
  that the route passes under some of the most beautiful scenery in
  England.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Mersey shipyard workers have made a demand on their employers for five
  pounds ten shillings a week when not working and seven pounds a week when
  working. This proposal to discriminate between the men who work and those
  who don't is condemned in more advanced trade union circles as savouring
  dangerously of capitalism.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"One evening at Covent Garden," says <font class="sc">M. Abel
  Hermant</font> in <i>Le Temps</i>, "will teach more correct behaviour
  than six months' lessons from a certified professor of etiquette."
  Opinion among the smart set is divided as to whether he means Covent
  Garden Theatre or Covent Garden Market.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The Bolshevists in Petrograd are finding a difficulty in the
  appointment of a public executioner. This is just the chance for a man
  who wants a nice steady job.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>On looking up our diary we find that the <font class="sc">Mad
  Mullah</font> is just about due to be killed again. We wonder if anything
  is being done in the matter.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A German merchant is anxious to get into touch with a big stamp-dealer
  in this country. Our feeling is that the <font
  class="sc">Postmaster-General</font> is the man he wants.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>We are asked to deny the rumour that Sir <font class="sc">Philip
  Sassoon</font> has been appointed touring manager to the Peace
  Conference.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A Newbury man has succeeded in breeding pink-coated tame rats. It is
  said that the Prohibitionists hope to exterminate these, as they did the
  green ones.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A blunder of thirty million pounds in the estimates for British
  operations in Russia is revealed in a White Paper. It is expected that
  the Government will bequeath it to the nation.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Owing to the high cost of material we understand that a certain pill
  is to-day worth £1 11<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a box.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The Sinn Feiners now threaten to capture one of our new battleships.
  We sincerely hope that the Government will place a caretaker on board
  each of our most valuable Dreadnoughts.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A Lanarkshire magistrate the other day doubted whether a miner could
  remember details of an accident which happened two years ago. It is said
  that the miner had vivid recollections of the affair as it happened to be
  the day he was at work.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It is urged that all taxi-cabs should have a cowcatcher in front in
  case of accidents. We gather that the drivers are quite willing provided
  they are allowed to charge for anyone they pick up as an "extra."</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It is reported that the muzzling order may come into force again in
  South Wales. We understand that a dog which thoughtlessly attempted to
  bark in Welsh in the main street of Cardiff was responsible for the
  belief that rabies had broken out again.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>During a brass-band contest a few days ago three members of the
  winning band were taken ill just after they had finished playing. It was
  at first feared that they had overblown themselves.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"A true lover of nature is nowadays very hard to find," complains a
  writer in a Nature journal. Yet we know a golfer who always shouts
  "Fore!" on slicing a ball into a spinney.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The two African lions which escaped from the Zoo in Portugal have not
  yet been captured, and were last seen near the border-line of
  Switzerland. It is thought that they are endeavouring to walk across
  Europe as a reprisal for the flight across Africa by two Europeans.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The Dublin Trades Council called a one-day strike last week "to secure
  the release of Mr. <font class="sc">James Larkin</font>." So successful
  was the strike, we understand, that the United States authorities have
  decided that the presence of Mr. <font class="sc">Larkin</font> at
  forthcoming celebrations of a similar character would be quite
  superfluous.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Speaking to an audience of miners at Morpeth Mr. <font
  class="sc">Ramsay Macdonald</font> said he dreamed of a time when the
  miners would govern the country. Not even the miners, on the other hand,
  would dream of letting Mr. <font class="sc">Ramsay Macdonald</font>
  govern it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Does the Government realise," asks a newspaper correspondent, "that
  as regards the situation in Ireland we are on the edge of a crater or
  with a thunderbolt over our heads?" We rather imagine that the
  Government, like the writer, isn't quite sure which.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Oswestry Guardians have accepted an offer to supply Bibles to tramps.
  This is the first occasion on which the current belief that the tramp
  class is nowadays being recruited largely from the ranks of the minor
  clergy has received formal recognition.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A bricklayer has been summoned for not sending his son to school. It
  appears that the father, finding his boy could count up to twenty and
  wishing him to follow his own occupation, thought further schooling
  unnecessary.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"When the country really understands the need of the Government," says
  an essayist, "we shall travel far." But not at twopence a mile, thank
  you.</p>

<h2>A CRIMINAL TYPE.</h2>

  <p>To-day I am MAKing aN inno6£vation. as you mayalready have gessed, I
  am typlng this article myself Zz½lnstead of writing it, The idea is to
  save time and exvBKpense, also to demonstyap demonBTrike= =damn, to
  demonstratO that I can type /ust as well as any blessedgirl 1f I give my
  mInd to iT"" Typlng while you compose is realy extraoraordinarrily easy,
  though composing whilr you typE is more difficult. I rather think my
  typing style is going to be different froM my u6sual style, but Idaresay
  noone will mind that much. looking back i see that we made rather a hash
  of that awfuul wurd extraorordinnaryk? in the middle of a woRd like
  thaton N-e gets quite lost? 2hy do I keep putting questionmarks instead
  of fulstopSI wonder. Now you see i have put a fulllstop instead Of a
  question mark it nevvvver reins but it pours.</p>

  <p>the typewriter to me has always been a mustery£? and even now that I
  have gained a perfect mastery over the machine in gront of me i have npt
  th3 faintest idea hoW it workss% &amp;or instance why does the
  thingonthetop the klnd of overhead Wailway arrrangement move along one
  pace afterr every word; I haVe exam@aaa ined the mechanism from all
  points of view but there seeems to be noreason atall whyit shouould do
  t£is . damn that £, it keeps butting in: it is Just lik real life. then
  there are all kinds oF attractive devisesand levers andbuttons of which
  is amanvel in itself, and does somethI5g useful without lettin on how it
  does iT.</p>

  <p>Forinstance on this machinE which is A mi/et a mijge7 imean a mi/dgt,
  made of alumium,, and very light sothat you caN CARRY it about on your
  £olidays (there is that £ again) and typeout your poems onthe Moon
  immmmediately, and there is onely one lot of keys for capITals and
  ordinay latters; when you want todoa Capital you press down a special key
  marked cap i mean CAP with the lefft hand and yo7 press down the letter
  withthe other, like that abcd, no, ABCDEFG . how jolly that looks . as a
  mattr of fact th is takes a little gettingintoas all the letters on the
  keys are printed incapitals so now and then one forgets topress downthe
  SPecial capit al key. not often, though. on the other hand onceone £as
  got it down and has written anice nam e in capitals like LLOYdgeORGE IT
  IS VERY DIFFICULT TO REmemBER TO PUT IT DOWN AGAIN ANDTHE N YOU GET THIS
  SORT OF THING WICH SPOILS THE LOOOK OF THE HOLE PAGE . or els insted of
  preSSing down the key marked CAP onepresses down the key m arked FIG and
  then insted of LLOYDGEORGE you find that you have written ½½96% :394:3.
  this is very dissheartening and £t is no wonder that typists are sooften
  sououred in ther youth.</p>

  <p>Apart fromthat though the key marked FIG is rather fun, since you can
  rite such amusing things withit, things like % and &#x263A; and dear old
  &amp; not to mention = and ¼ and ¾ and!!! i find that inones ordinarry (i
  never get that word right) cor orresponden£c one doesn't use expressions
  like @@ and % % % nearly enough. typewriting gives you a new ideaof
  possibilities of the engli£h language; thE more i look at % the more
  beautiful it seems to Be: and like the simple flowers of england itis
  per£aps most beauti£ul when seeen in the masss, Look atit</p>

  <p>how would thatdo for a BAThrooM wallpaper? it could be produced verery
  cheaply and itcould be calld the CHER RYdesigN damn, imeant to put all
  that in capitals. iam afraid this articleis spoilt now but butt bUt curse
  . But perhaps the most excitingthing a£out this mac£ine is that you can
  by presssing alittle switch suddenly writein redor green instead of in
  black; I donvt understanh how £t is done butit is very jollY? busisisness
  men us e the device a gre t deal wen writing to their membersof
  PARLIAment, in order to emphasasise the pointin wich the£r in£ustice is
  worSe than anyone elses in£ustice . wen they come to WE ARE RUINED they
  burst out into red and wen they come to WE w WOULD remIND YOU tHAT ATtHE
  LAST E£ECTION yoU UNDERTOOk they burst into GReeN. thei r typists must
  enjoy doing those letters. with this arrang ment of corse one coul d do
  allkinds of capital wallpapers. for |nstance wat about a scheme of red
  £'s and black %'s and gReen &amp;'s? this sort of thing</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Manya poor man would be glad to £ave that in his parLour ratherthan
  wat he has got now. of corse, you wont be ab?e to apreciate the fulll
  bauty of the design since i underst and that the retched paper which is
  going to print this has no redink and no green inq either; so you must
  £ust immagine that the £'s are red and the &amp;'s are green. it is
  extroarordinarry (wat a t erribleword!!!) how backward in MAny waYs these
  uptodate papers are wwww¼¼¼¼¼¼½=¾ now how did that happen i wond er; i
  was experimenting with the BACK SPACE key; if that is wat it is for i
  dont thinq i shall use it again. iI wonder if i am impriving at this½
  sometimes i thinq i am and so metimes i thinq iam not . we have not had
  so many £'s lately but i notice that theere have been one or two
  misplaced q's &amp; icannot remember to write i in capital s there it
  goes again.</p>

  <p>Of curse the typewriter itself is not wolly giltless ½ike all
  mac&amp;ines it has amind of it sown and is of like passsions with
  ourselves. i could put that into greek if only the machine was not so
  hopelessly MOdern. it 's chief failing is that it cannot write
  m'sdecently and instead of h it will keep putting that confounded £. as
  amatter of fact ithas been doing m's rather better today butthat is only
  its cusssedussedness and because i have been opening my shoul ders
  wenever we have come to an m; or should it be A m? who can tell; little
  peculiuliarities like making indifferent m's are very important &amp;
  w£en one is bying a typewiter one s£ould make careful enquiries about
  themc; because it is things of that sort wich so often give criminals
  away. there is notHing a detective likes so much as a type riter with an
  idiosxz an idioynq damit an idiotyncrasy . for instance if i commit a
  murder i s£ould not thinq of writing a litter about it with this of all
  typewriters becusa because that fool ofa £ would give me away at once I
  daresay scotland Yard have got specimens of my trypewriting locked up in
  some pigeonhole allready. if they £avent they ought to; it ought to be
  part of my dosossier.</p>

  <p>i thing the place of the hypewriter in ART is inshufficiently
  apreciated. Modern art i understand is chiefly sumbolical expression and
  straigt lines. a typwritr can do strait lines with the under lining mark)
  and there are few more atractive symbols thaN the symbols i have used in
  this articel; i merely thro out the sugestion</p>

  <p>I dont tkink i shal do many more articles like this it is tooo much
  like work? but I am glad I have got out of that £ habit;</p>

<h2>ELIZABETH GOES ON HOLIDAY.</h2>

  <p>"Please, 'm, may I go for my 'olidays a week come Thursday?" asked
  Elizabeth. She was evidently labouring under some strong excitement, for
  she panted as she spoke and so far forgot herself in her agitation as to
  take up the dust in the hall instead of sweeping it under the mat.</p>

  <p>"But you promised to go on your holiday when we have ours in
  September," I protested, aghast. (You will shortly understand the reason
  of my dismay.) "I don't see how I can possibly manage&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, 'm, but I <i>must</i> take 'em then," interposed Elizabeth
  with a horrid giving-notice gleam in her eye which I have learnt to
  dread. "You see, my young man is 'avin' 'is 'olidays then
  an'&mdash;an'"&mdash;she drew up her lank form and a look that was almost
  human came into her face&mdash;"'e's arsked me to go with 'im," she
  finished with ineffable pride.</p>

  <p>I am aware that this is not an unusual arrangement amongst engaged
  couples in the class to which Elizabeth belongs; nevertheless I felt it
  was the moment for judicious advice, knowing how ephemeral are the
  love-affairs of Elizabeth. No butterfly that flits from flower to flower
  could be more elusive than her young men. Our district must swarm with
  this fickle type.</p>

  <p>"Do you think it right to go off on a holiday with a stranger?" I
  began diffidently.</p>

  <p>"'Im! 'E isn't a stranger," broke in Elizabeth. "'E's my young
  man."</p>

  <p>"Which young man?"</p>

  <p>"My <i>new</i> young man."</p>

  <p>"But don't you think it would be better if he were not such a new
  young man&mdash;I mean, if he were an old young
  man&mdash;er&mdash;perhaps I ought to say you should know him longer
  before you go away with him. It's not quite the thing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why, wot's wrong with it?" demanded Elizabeth, puzzled. "All the
  girls I know spends their 'olidays with their young men, an' then it
  doesn't cost them nothink. That's the best of it. But it's the first time
  I've ever been arsked," she admitted, "an' I wouldn't lose a charnce like
  this for anythink."</p>

  <p>Further appeal was useless, and with a sigh I resigned myself to the
  inevitable; but when, ten days later, Elizabeth departed in a whirl of
  enthusiasm and brown paper parcels I turned dejectedly to the loathsome
  business of housework.</p>

  <p>It is a form of labour which above all others I detest. My
  <i>métier</i> is to write&mdash;one day I even hope to become a great
  writer. But what I never hope to become is a culinary expert. Should you
  command your cook to turn out a short story she could not suffer more in
  the agonies of composition than I do in making a simple Yorkshire
  pudding.</p>

  <p>My household now passed into a condition of settled gloom. My nerves
  began to suffer from the strain, and I came gradually to regard Henry as
  less of a helpmate and more of a voracious monster demanding meals at too
  frequent intervals. It made me peevish with him.</p>

  <p>He too was far from forbearing in this crisis. In fact we were getting
  disillusioned with each other.</p>

  <p>One evening I was reflecting bitterly on matters like washing-up when
  Henry came in. Only a short time before we should have greeted each other
  cordially in a spirit of <i>camaraderie</i> and affection. Now our
  conversation was something like this:&mdash;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg 65]</span>

  <p><i>Henry (gruffly).</i> Hullo, no signs of dinner yet! Do you know the
  time?</p>

  <p><i>Me (snappily).</i> You needn't be so impatient. I expect you've
  gorged yourself on a good lunch in town. Anyhow it won't take long to get
  dinner, as we are having tinned soup and eggs.</p>

  <p><i>Henry.</i> Oh, damn eggs. I'm sick of the sight of 'em.</p>

  <p>You can see for yourself how unrestrained we were getting. The thin
  veneer of civilisation (thinner than ever when Henry is hungry) was fast
  wearing into holes.</p>

  <p>The subsequent meal was eaten in silence. The hay-fever from which I
  am prone to suffer at all seasons of the year was particularly persistent
  that evening. A rising irritability engendered by leathery eggs and
  fostered by Henry's face was taking possession of me. Quite suddenly I
  discovered that the way he held his knife annoyed me. Further I was
  maddened by his manner of taking soup. But I restrained myself. I merely
  remarked, "You have finished your soup, I <i>hear</i>, love."</p>

  <p>Henry, though feeling the strain, had not quite lost his fortitude. My
  hay-fever was obviously annoying him, but he only commented, "Don't you
  think you ought to see a doctor about that distressing nasal complaint,
  my dear?" I knew, however, that he was longing to bark out, "Can't you
  stop that everlasting sniffing? It's driving me mad, woman."</p>

  <p>How long would it be before we reached that stage of candour? I was
  brooding on this when the front-door bell rang.</p>

  <p>"You go," I said to Henry.</p>

  <p>"No, you go," he replied. "It looks bad for the man of the house to
  answer the door."</p>

  <p>I do not know why it should look bad for a man to answer his own door,
  unless he is a bad man. But there are some things in our English social
  system which no one can understand. I rose and went to open the
  front-door. Then my heart leapt in sudden joy. The light from the hall
  lamp fell on the lank form of Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>"You've come back!" I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you didn't expect to see me inside of a week," she
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"I didn't; but oh, Elizabeth, I'm so glad to see you," I said as I
  drew her in. Tears that strong men weep rose to my eyes, while Henry, at
  this moment emerging from the study, uttered an ejaculation of joy (it
  sounded like "Thank God!") at the sight of Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>"An' 'ow 'ave you got on while I've bin away?" she inquired, eyeing us
  both closely. "Did every think go orf orl right?"</p>

  <p>I hesitated. How was I to confess my failures and muddling in her
  absence and hope to have authority over her in future? Would she not
  become still more difficult to manage if she knew how indispensable she
  was? I continued to hesitate. Then Henry spoke. "We've managed
  admirably," he said. "Your mistress has been wonderful. Her cooking has
  absolutely surprised me."</p>

  <p>I blessed Henry (the devil!) in that moment. "Thank you, dear," I
  murmured.</p>

  <p>Then Elizabeth spoke and there was a note of relief in her voice.
  "Well, I'm reerly glad to 'ear that, as I can go off to-morrer after all.
  I 'aven't been for my 'oliday yet, like."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" I gasped.</p>

  <p>"Well, you see, 'm, my young man didn't turn up at the station, so I
  went and stayed with my sister-in-law at Islington. She wants me to go
  with 'er to Southend early to-morrer, but I thort as 'ow I'd better come
  back 'ere first and see if you reerly could manage without me, for I 'ad
  my doubts. 'Owever, as everythink's goin' on orl right I can go with an
  easy mind."</p>

  <p>I remained speechless. So did Henry. Elizabeth went out again into the
  darkness. There was a long pause, broken only by my hay fever. Then Henry
  spoke. "Can't you stop that everlasting sniffing?" he barked out. "It's
  driving me mad, woman."</p>

<p class="center"><font class="sc">IV.&mdash;What's Wrong with the Drama?</font></p>

<p class="center"><i>By Marcus P. Brimston, the gifted producer of "Shoo,
Charlotte!"</i></p>

  <p>I have been invited to say a few words to readers of <i>The Sabbath
  Scoop</i> on the alleged decay of the British drama. There is indeed some
  apparent truth in this allegation. On all sides I hear managers sending
  up the same old wail of dwindling box-office receipts and houses packed
  with ghastly rows of deadheads. No "paper" shortage there, at any
  rate.</p>

  <p>Sometimes these unfortunate people come to me for counsel, and
  invariably I give them the same admonition, "Study your public."</p>

  <p>There is no doubt that, with a few brilliant exceptions (among which
  my own present production is happily enrolled), the playhouses have
  recently struck a rather bad patch. Useless to lay the blame either on
  the <font class="sc">Chancellor of the Exchequer</font> or on the
  weather. Give the playgoing public what it wants and no consideration of
  National Waste or of Daylight Saving will keep it from the theatre.</p>

  <p>And that brings me to my point. Whence comes the playgoing public of
  to-day, and what does it want?</p>

  <p>From the commercial point of view (and in the long run as in the short
  all art must be judged by its monetary value) the drama depends for its
  support on what used to be known as the better-dressed parts of the
  house. Now-a-days the majority of the paying patrons of these seats come
  from the ranks of the new custodians of the nation's wealth. These
  people, who have the business instinct very strongly developed,
  insistently and very rightly demand value for their money; and the
  problem is how to give them value as they understand the meaning of the
  word. My friend Mr. <font class="sc">Arthur Collins</font> gives it to
  them in sand; but that is a shifting foundation on which to build up a
  prosperous run.</p>

  <p>Those who, like myself, have studied closely the tastes and
  intelligence of this new force that is directing the destiny of the
  modern theatre must have come to the conclusion that the essential factor
  in dramatic success is "punch," or, as our cross-Atlantic cousins would
  term it, "pep." The day of anæmic characterisation and subtle dissection
  of motives is past. The audience (or the only part that really counts)
  has no desire to be called upon to think; it can afford to pay others to
  do its thinking for it. There is much to be said for this point of view.
  The War and its effects (especially the Excess Profits Duty) have imposed
  on us all far too many and too severe mental jerks; in the theatre we may
  well forget that we possess such a thing as a mind.</p>

  <p>As a charming and gifted little actress said to me only yesterday, "We
  want something a bit meatier than the dry old bones of <font
  class="sc">Ibsen's</font> ghosts." Well, I am out to provide that
  something; my present success certainly does not lack for flesh.</p>

  <p>In producing <i>Shoo, Charlotte!</i> I have taken several hints from
  that formidable young rival of the articulate stage known as the Silent
  Drama. There effects are flung at the spectator's head like balls at a
  cocoanut; if they fail to register a hit it is the fault of the shier,
  not of the nut. My aim throughout has been to throw hard and true, so
  that even the thickest nut is left in no doubt as to the actuality of the
  impact. <i>Shoo, Charlotte!</i> makes no high-sounding attempt at
  improving the public taste. As the dramatic critic of <i>The Sabbath
  Scoop</i> pithily remarked, it is just "one long feast of laughter and
  <i>lingerie</i>," and its nightly triumph is the only vindication it
  requires.</p>

  <p>The fundamental mistake of the British drama of to-day lies, in my
  humble opinion, in its perpetual striving after the unexpected. The
  public, such as I have described it, fights shy of novel situations; it
  isn't sure how they ought to be taken. But give it a play where it knows
  exactly what is going to happen next and you are rewarded with the
  delighted applause that comes of prophecy fulfilled. The thrill or
  chuckle of anticipation is succeeded by the shudder or guffaw of
  realisation. Father nudges Mother and says, "Look, Emma, he's going to
  fall into the flour-bin." He does fall into the flour-bin, and Father
  slaps his own or Mother's knee with a roar of triumph. After all, the old
  dramatic formulæ were not drawn up without a profound knowledge of human
  nature.</p>

  <p>Let managers take a lesson from these few observations and they will
  no longer go about seeking an answer to the riddle, "Why did the cocoanut
  shy?"</p>

<h2>WAYS AND MEANS.</h2>

  <p>I have read somewhere that when and/or if railway fares are increased
  it will cost a man travelling with his wife and two children (the
  children being half-fares) as much as twenty pounds to take third-class
  return tickets to St. Ives.</p>

  <p>Presumably this refers to the Cornish St. Ives, and to show how
  serious the problem will be for quite large families I need only refer my
  readers to the well-known poetical riddle which is generally supposed to
  refer to the Cornish St. Ives too. It will be seen at once that in the
  case of a septuagamist going to or returning from St. Ives with his
  family the cost will be vastly greater, even if no special luggage rates
  are leviable for the carriage of excess cats.</p>

  <p>Fortunately there is a much nearer St. Ives in Huntingdonshire, and if
  I was going to St. Ives at all, with or without encumbrances, I should
  certainly choose that one. As a matter of fact the Huntingdonshire St.
  Ives is a very pleasant place indeed, with a lot of red-and-yellow cattle
  standing about, if one may take the authority of the County Card Game in
  these matters. It is almost as pleasant as Luton, where there is a fellow
  in a blue smock with side-whiskers and a reaping-hook, and Leicester,
  which consists solely of a windmill and a house where <font
  class="sc">Richard III</font>. slept on the night before the Battle of
  Bosworth Field. Not a word about <font class="sc">Ramsay
  Macdonald</font>.</p>

  <p>But we are not talking about <font class="sc">Ramsay Macdonald</font>
  and the County Card Game; we are talking about Sir <font class="sc">Eric
  Geddes</font> and his railway fares, and talking pretty sharply too. What
  is to be done about this monstrous imposition? And how are we going to
  show the Government that you cannot play about with ozone as you can with
  margarine and coal? If only all passengers were prepared to act in
  concert it would be easy enough to bring Sir <font class="sc">Eric</font>
  to his knees. The best and simplest plan would be for everybody to ask at
  the booking-office for a half-fare, stating boldly that his or her age
  was exactly eleven years and eleven months. It might not sound very
  convincing, of course, even if you had a red-and-black cricket-cap on the
  back of your head and covered your beard or what not with one hand; but a
  constant succession of people all demanding the same thing would most
  certainly cause the booking-clerk to give way. It might occur to him
  besides that, since so many people insisted on giving their wrong ages
  for the pleasure of fighting in war-time, they had a perfect right to do
  the same for the pleasure of travelling in peace-time; and in the case of
  the women his reputation for gallantry would be imperilled if he had the
  impudence to doubt their word.</p>

  <p>But would everybody be prepared to take up this strong and reasonable
  line? I doubt it, and we must turn to the consideration of other
  economical devices.</p>

  <p>One plan which I do not honestly recommend is travelling under the
  seats of the railway compartment, like <i>Paul Bultitude</i> in <i>Vice
  Versa</i>. I say this partly because the accommodation under the seats is
  not all that it ought to be, and even where there is no heating apparatus
  a tight fit for large families, and partly because you have to face the
  possibility that your tickets may be demanded on the platform at the
  other end. Nor do I favour the method invariably adopted by people in
  cinema plays, which is to sit on the buffers or the roofs, or conceal
  yourself among the brakes or whatever they are underneath the carriages.
  Unless you drop off just before the terminus, which hurts, the same
  objection arises as in the under-the-seat method; and in any case you are
  practically certain to be spotted not only by the officials of the
  railway company concerned but with axle-grease.</p>

  <p>It is of course possible to travel without concealment and without a
  ticket either, merely discovering with a start of surprise when you are
  asked for it that you have lost the beastly thing. But this involves
  acting. It involves hunting with a great appearance of energy and haste
  in all your pockets, your reticule, your hatband, the turn-ups of your
  trousers, <i>The Rescue</i> (for you certainly used something as a
  book-marker) and finally turning out in front of all the other passengers
  the whole of your note-case, which proves that you cannot have been going
  to stay at the "Magnificent" after all, and the envelopes of all the old
  letters which you were taking down to the sea in the hopes of answering
  them there; and even after that you have to give the name and address of
  somebody you don't like (say Sir <font class="sc">Eric Geddes</font>) to
  satisfy the inspector.</p>

  <p>On the whole I think the best way is the one which I mean to adopt
  myself at the earliest opportunity. Let us suppose that you are going to
  Brighton. At Victoria Station you will purchase (1) a return ticket to
  Streatham Common, (2) a platform ticket. The platform ticket entitles you
  to walk on to the platform from which the Brighton train starts, and,
  when it is just moving out and all the tickets have been looked at, you
  will leap on board. This brings you to Brighton, and all you have to do
  there is to accost the man who takes the tickets in a voice hoarse with
  fury. "Look here," you will say, "I had an important business engagement
  at Streatham Common, worth thousands and thousands of pounds to me, and
  one of your fool porters told me a wrong platform at Victoria. What are
  you going to do about it?" Now you might think that the porter would
  reply, "Come off it, Mister; you don't kid me like that," or make some
  other disappointing and impolite remark; but not a bit of it. Bluster is
  the thing that pays. First of all he will apologise, and then he will
  fetch the station-master, and he will apologise too, and after <span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg 69]</span> a bit
  they will offer you a special train back to Streatham Common, probably
  the one the <font class="sc">King</font> uses when he goes to the
  seaside. But you will of course refuse to be pacified and wave it away,
  saying, "Useless, absolutely useless. Now that I am in this awful hole I
  shall spend the night here. But I shall certainly sue your Company for
  the amount of the business that I have lost."</p>

  <p>That is what I mean to do, and with slight variations the ruse can be
  applied to almost any non-stop run. Now that I have given the tip I shall
  hope to find quite a little crowd of disappointed business men round the
  station exits at holiday time when and/or if railway fares are
  increased.</p>

<p class="center"><font class="sc">The Hyde Park Monument</font>.</p>

  <p><font class="sc">Dear Sir</font>,&mdash;The experience of the Parisian
  scavenger who recently discovered a crocodile in a dustbin encourages me
  to write to you on a similar subject. I note with profound dismay the
  proposal to turn Hyde Park into a Zoological Garden. At least this is not
  an unfair deduction from the scheme to instal a huge python in the
  neighbourhood of Hyde Park Corner. I do not profess to know much about
  snakes, but I believe the python is a most dangerous reptile, and I see
  it stated that the pythons which have just arrived at Regent's Park are
  "large and vigorous, already active and looking for food." Surely this
  monstrous suggestion, threatening the safety of the peaceful frequenters
  of the Park, calls for a national protest. Can it be that the <font
  class="sc">Premier</font> is at the back of this, as of every invasion of
  our rights?</p>

  <p><font class="sc">Dear Sir</font>,&mdash;My grandfather, who died in

  Forest, an extraordinarily absent-minded man with a beard of such
  colossal dimensions that several of the feathered denizens of the forest
  took up their abode in its recesses. This curious phenomenon was, I
  believe, commemorated in verse by an early-Victorian poet, but I have not
  been able after considerable research to trace the reference. I have the

    <p class="center">THE INCOHERENTS.</p>

    <p>The reply of the Soviet Government to the Spa Conference was
    described by Mr. <font class="sc">Lloyd George</font> as "incoherent;
    the sort of document that might be drawn up by a committee composed of
    Colonel <font class="sc">Wedgwood</font>, Commander <font
    class="sc">Kenworthy</font>, Lord <font class="sc">Robert Cecil</font>,
    Mr. <font class="sc">Bottomley</font> and Mr. <font
    class="sc">Thomas</font>." It is understood that these hon. Members
    intend to hold an indignation meeting to discuss means&mdash;if

  </div>
  <p><i>Monday, July 19th.</i>&mdash;Opinions may differ as to the wisdom
  of the Peers in reopening the <font class="sc">Dyer</font> case, but the
  large audience which assembled in the galleries, where Peeresses and
  Indians vied with one another in the gorgeousness of their attire,
  testified to the public interest in the debate. At first the speakers
  made no attempt to "hot up" their cold porridge. In presenting General
  <font class="sc">Dyer's</font> case Lord <font class="sc">Finlay</font>
  was strong without rage. In rebutting it the <font
  class="sc">Under-Secretary for India</font> proved himself a grave and
  reverend <font class="sc">Sinha</font>, without a trace of the
  provocativeness displayed by his Chief in the Commons. Not until the
  <font class="sc">Lord Chancellor</font> intervened did the temperature
  begin to rise. His description of the incident in the Jullianwallah Bagh
  was only a little less lurid than that of Mr. <font
  class="sc">Montagu</font>. The Peers would, I think, have liked a little
  more explanation of how an officer who admittedly exhibited, both before
  and after this painful affair, "discretion, sobriety and resolution,"
  should be regarded as having on this one day committed "a tragic error of
  judgment upon the most conspicuous stage," and may have wondered whether,
  if the stage had been less conspicuous, the critics would have been more
  lenient.</p>

    <p>AN ARABIAN KNIGHT AT HOME. <font class="sc">Lord
    Winterton</font>.</p>
  </div>
  <p>For as long as I can remember the French have been <i>partant pour la
  Syrie</i>. Now they have got there, with a mandate from the Supreme
  Council, and have come into collision with the Arabs. As we are the
  friends of both parties the situation is a little awkward. Mr. <font
  class="sc">Ormsby-Gore</font> hoped we were not going to fight our Arab
  allies, and was supported by Lord <font class="sc">Winterton</font>, who
  saw service with them during the War. A diplomatic speech by Mr. <font
  class="sc">Bonar Law</font>, who pointed out that the French were in
  Syria on just the same conditions as we were in Mesopotamia, helped to
  keep the debate within safe limits.</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, July 20th.</i>&mdash;The Lords continued the <font
  class="sc">Dyer</font> debate. Lord <font class="sc">Milner</font>
  confessed that he had approached the subject "with a bias in favour of
  the soldier," and showed how completely he had overcome it by finally
  talking about "Prussian methods"&mdash;a phrase that Lord <font
  class="sc">Sumner</font> characterised as "facile but not convincing."
  Lord <font class="sc">Curzon</font> hoped that the Peers would not
  endorse such methods, but would be guided by the example of "Clemency"
  <font class="sc">Canning</font>. The Lords however, by 129 to 86, passed
  Lord <font class="sc">Finlay's</font> motion, to the effect that General
  <font class="sc">Dyer</font> had been unjustly treated and that a
  dangerous precedent had been established.</p>

  <p>The <font class="sc">First Commissioner of Works</font> was inundated
  with questions about the pylon and explained that it had been designed by
  Sir <font class="sc">Frank Baines</font> entirely on his own initiative.
  Its submission to the Cabinet had never been contemplated, and its
  exhibition in the Tea Room was due to an hon. Member, who said that a
  number of people would be interested. Apparently they were.</p>

  <p>Asked if the scheme might be regarded as quite dead, Sir <font
  class="sc">Alfred Mond</font> replied that he certainly thought so. In
  fact, to judge by his previous answer, it was never really alive.</p>

  <p>There is still anxious curiosity regarding the increase of railway
  fares, but when invited to "name the day" Mr. <font class="sc">Bonar
  Law</font> remained coy. Suggestions for postponements in the interests
  of this or that class of holiday-maker finally goaded him into asking
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg 74]</span>
  sarcastically, "Why not until after Christmas?" Whereupon the House
  loudly cheered.</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, July 21st.</i>&mdash;Tactful man, Lord <font
  class="sc">Desborough</font>. In urging the Government to call a
  Conference to consider the establishment of a fixed date for Easter he
  supported his case with a wealth of curious information, some of it
  acquired from the Prayer-book tables, as he said, "during the less
  interesting sermons to which I have listened." You or I would have said
  "dull" <i>tout court</i>, and in that case we should not have deserved to
  receive, as Lord <font class="sc">Desborough</font> did, the almost
  enthusiastic support of the Archbishop of <font
  class="sc">Canterbury</font>.</p>

  <p>In spite of this Lord <font class="sc">Onslow</font>, for the
  Government, was far from encouraging. He quite recognised the drawbacks
  of the movable Easter, and agreed that it was primarily a matter for the
  Churches. But he feared the Nonconformists might dissent, and displayed a
  hitherto unsuspected reverence for the opinion of the Armenians. Besides,
  what about the Dominions and Labour? And with Europe in such a state of
  unrest ought we to throw in a new apple of discord? With much regret the
  Government could not see their way, etc. Whereupon Lord <font
  class="sc">Desborough</font>, who seems to be easily satisfied, expressed
  his gratitude and withdrew his motion.</p>

  <p>In an expansive moment Mr. <font class="sc">Montagu</font> once
  referred to Mr. <font class="sc">Gandhi</font> as his "friend." He did
  so, it appears, in the hope that the eminent agitator would abandon his
  disloyal vapourings. But the friendship is now finally sundered. Mr.
  <font class="sc">Gandhi</font> has been endeavouring to organise a
  boycott of the <font class="sc">Prince of Wales'</font> visit to India,
  and, as Mr. <font class="sc">Montagu</font> observed more in sorrow than
  in anger, "Nobody who suggests disloyalty or discourtesy to the Crown can
  be a friend of any Member of this House, let alone a Minister."</p>

  <p>If anyone were to take exception to the accuracy of some of the <font
  class="sc">Prime Minister's</font> historical allusions in his post-Spa
  oration he would doubtless reply, "I don't read history; I make it." He
  was tart with the Turks, gratulatory to the Greeks, peevish with the
  Poles and gentle to the Germans. The German <font
  class="sc">Chancellor</font> and Herr <font class="sc">von Simons</font>
  were described as "two perfectly honest upright men, doing their best to
  cope with a gigantic task." Their country was making a real effort to
  meet the indemnity; it was not entirely responsible for the delay in
  trying the war-criminals, and even in the matter of disarmament was not
  altogether blameworthy. The Bolshevists also were handled more tenderly
  than usual. Their reply was "incoherent" rather than
  "impertinent"&mdash;it might have been drawn up by a <font
  class="sc">Wedgwood-Kenworthy-Cecil-Bottomley-Thomas</font> syndicate.
  Still they must not be allowed to wipe out Poland, foolish and reckless
  as the Poles had been.</p>

  <p>A well-informed speech was made by Mr. T. <font
  class="sc">Shaw</font>, evidently destined to be the Foreign Minister of
  the first Labour Cabinet. Having travelled in Russia he has acquired a
  distaste for the Soviet system, both political and industrial, and is
  confident that no amount of Bolshevist propaganda will induce the British
  proletarian to embrace a creed under which he would be compelled to
  work.</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, July. 22nd.</i>&mdash;The Peers held an academic
  discussion on the League of Nations. Lords <font
  class="sc">Parmoor</font>, <font class="sc">Bryce</font> and <font
  class="sc">Haldane</font>, who declared themselves its friends, were
  about as cheerful as <font class="sc">Job's</font> Comforters; Lord <font
  class="sc">Sydenham</font> was frankly sceptical of the success of a body
  that had, and could have, no effective force behind it; and Lord <font
  class="sc">Curzon</font> was chiefly concerned to dispel the prevalent
  delusion that the League is a branch of the British Foreign Office.</p>

  <p>The Commons had an equally unappetising bill-of-fare, in which Ireland
  figured appropriately as the <i>pièce de résistance</i>. Sir <font
  class="sc">John Rees'</font> well-meant endeavour to furnish some lighter
  refreshment by an allusion to the Nauru islanders' habit of "broiling
  their brothers for breakfast" fell a little flat. The latest news from
  Belfast suggests that in the expression of brotherly love Queen's Island
  has little to learn from Nauru.</p>

<h2>A SCENE AT THE CLUB.</h2>

  <p>I never liked Buttinbridge. I considered him a vulgar and pushful
  fellow. He had thrust himself into membership of my club and he had
  forced his acquaintance upon me.</p>

  <p>I was sitting in the club smoking-room the other day when Buttinbridge
  came in. His behaviour was characteristic of the man. He walked towards
  me and said in a loud voice, "Cheerioh, old Sport!"</p>

  <p>I drew the little automatic pistol with which I had provided myself in
  case of just such an emergency, took a quick aim and fired. Buttinbridge
  gave a convulsive leap, fell face downwards on the hearthrug and lay
  quite still. It was a beautiful shot&mdash;right in the heart.</p>

  <p>The room was fairly full at the moment, and at the sound of the shot
  several members looked up from their newspapers. One young fellow&mdash;I
  fancy he was a country member recently demobilised&mdash;who had
  evidently watched the incident, exclaimed, "Pretty shot, Sir!" But two or
  three of the older men frowned irritably and said, "Sh-sh-sh!"</p>

  <p>Seeing that it was incumbent upon me to apologise, I said, in a tone
  just loud enough to be audible to all present, "I beg your pardon,
  gentlemen." Then I dropped the spent cartridge into an ash-tray, returned
  the pistol to my pocket and was just stretching out my hand to touch the
  bell when old Withergreen, the <i>doyen</i> of the club, interposed.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me," he said, "I am a little deaf, but almost simultaneously
  with the fall of this member upon the hearthrug I fancied I heard the
  report of a firearm. May I claim an old man's privilege and ask if I am
  right in presuming a connection between the two occurrences, and, if so,
  whether there has been any recent relaxation of our time-honoured rule
  against assassination on the club premises?"</p>

  <p>Shouting into his ear-trumpet, I said, "I fired the shot, Sir, which
  killed the member now lying upon the hearthrug. I did so because he
  addressed me in a form of salutation which I regard as peculiarly
  objectionable. He called me 'Old Sport,' an expression used by bookmakers
  and such."</p>

  <p>"Um! Old Port?" mumbled old Withergreen.</p>

  <p>"<font class="sc">Old Sport</font>," I shouted more loudly. Then I
  stepped to the writing-table, took a dictionary from among the books of
  reference, found the place I wanted and returned to the ear-trumpet.</p>

  <p>"I find here," I said, for the benefit of the room at large, for all
  were now <span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg
  75]</span> listening, though with some impatience, "that in calling me a
  '<i>sport</i>' the deceased member called me a plaything, a diversion. If
  he had called me a <i>sportsman</i>, which is here defined as 'one who
  hunts, fishes or fowls,' he would have been not necessarily more accurate
  but certainly less offensive."</p>

  <p>At this point there stood up a member whom I recognised as one of the
  committee. "I am sure, Sir," he said, "that all present are agreed that
  you fired in defence of the purity of English speech, and that the
  incident was the outcome of an unfortunate attempt to relieve the
  financial embarrassment of the club by relaxing our former rigorous
  exclusiveness. Speaking as one of the committee, I have no doubt that the
  affair will be dismissed as <i>justifiable homicide</i>."</p>

  <p>Having bowed my acknowledgments I rang the bell. When the waiter
  appeared I bade him "Bring me a black coffee and then clear away the
  remains of Mr. Buttinbridge."</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Then I was awakened by the voice of Buttinbridge yelling, "Wake up,
  old Sport!"</p>

<h2>THE PECULIAR CASE OF TOLLER.</h2>

  <p>Toller first floated into public notice on the fame of Rodman, who by
  an irony of fate is now all but forgotten. Rodman, it may be remembered,
  was a promising young poet during the first decade of this century. Out
  of a scandalous youth whose verses made their appearance in slim
  periodicals that expired before their periodicity could be computed, he
  was evolving into a reputable poet who was given a prominent position
  facing advertising matter in the heavy magazines when he met with his
  regrettably early end. Apart from his poems he left no literary remains,
  except a few letters too hideously ungrammatical for publication. The
  sole materials for a biography lay in the memory of Toller, who by a
  stroke of luck happened to have known him intimately.</p>

  <p>By an equal piece of good fortune Toller had taken a course of mind
  training and his memory was exceptionally retentive. His <i>Life of
  Rodman</i> achieved instant success, a far greater than <i>Rodman's
  Collected Works</i>. The undomesticities of a poet's life naturally
  excite greater interest in the cultured than his utterances on Love,
  Destiny and other topics on which poets are apt to discourse. Toller,
  until then a struggling journalist, became all at once a minor literary
  celebrity, much in demand at conversaziones and places where they
  chatter. Sympathy for Rodman aroused curiosity which only Toller could
  satisfy.</p>

  <p>His memory, continually stimulated by questions, gained further in
  strength. The more he was asked the more he remembered, and so on in a
  virtuous circle. His Rodmaniana provided him with a comfortable income.
  He removed from Earl's Court to luxurious chambers off Jermyn Street,
  from which he poured out article after article on the deceased poet.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly, without warning, probably from overstrain, his memory
  gave way. Everything in the past, Rodman included, vanished from his
  mind. A greater calamity one could not conceive. It was as though a
  violinist had lost a hand, a popular preacher his voice. His livelihood
  was gone. Much as his babble about Rodman had bored me I could not but
  feel some sorrow for him, fallen from his little pinnacle of fame and
  affluence. Judge, then, of my surprise when I passed him about a
  fortnight ago faultlessly dressed and wearing an air of great prosperity.
  He showed of course not the smallest recollection of me.</p>

  <p>"How does Toller manage to live?" I asked Cardew, who knows him better
  than I do.</p>

  <p>"He still writes," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;without a memory?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he finds it an advantage. You see, since the fusion of the old
  parties and the formation of new ones, the possession of a memory is
  often a source of considerable embarrassment to a leader writer. Toller
  now does the political articles for a prominent morning paper. The
  proprietors consider him a wonderful find."</p>

<h2>BUCKLER'S.</h2>

  <p>To acquire an estate is, even in these days of inflated prices and
  competitive house-hunters, an easy matter compared with finding a name
  for it when it is yours. It is then that the real trouble sets in.</p>

  <p>Take the case of my friend Buckler.</p>

  <p>A little while ago he purchased a property, a few acres on the very
  top of a hill not too far from London and only half-a-mile from his
  present habitation, and there he is now building a home. At least the
  plans are done and the ground has been pegged out. "Here," he will say,
  quite unmindful of the clouds emptying themselves all over us&mdash;with
  all an enthusiast's disregard for others, and an enthusiast, moreover,
  who has his abode close by, full of changes of raiment&mdash;"here,"
  setting his foot firmly in the mud, "is where the dining-room will be.
  Here," moving away a few yards through the slush, "is the billiard-room."
  Then, pointing towards the zenith with his stick, "Above it"&mdash;here
  you look up into the pitiless sky as well as the deluge will
  permit&mdash;"are two spare rooms, one of which will be yours when you
  come to see us." And so forth.</p>

  <p>He then leads the way round the place, through brake fern wetter than
  waves, to indicate the position of the tennis-courts, and in course of
  time you are allowed to return to the dry and spend the rest of the day
  in borrowed clothes.</p>

  <p>Everyone knows these Kubla Khans decreeing pleasure domes and
  enlarging upon them in advance of the builders, and never are they so
  eloquent and unmindful of rain and discomforts as when their listeners
  are poor and condemned to a squalid London existence for ever.</p>

  <p>But that is beside the mark. It is the naming of these new country
  seats that leads to such difficulties.</p>

  <p>That night at dinner the question arose again.</p>

  <p>"As it is on the top of the hill," said a gentle wistful lady, "why
  not call it 'Hill Top'? I'm sure I've seen that name before. It is
  expressive and simple."</p>

  <p>"So simple," said Buckler, "that my nearest neighbour has already
  appropriated it."</p>

  <p>"I suppose that would be an objection," said the lady, and we all
  agreed.</p>

  <p>"Why not," said another guest, "call it 'The Summit'? or, more
  concisely, just 'Summit'?"</p>

  <p>"Or why not go further," said a frivolous voice, "and suggest
  hospitality too&mdash;and Buckler's hospitality is notorious&mdash;by
  calling it 'Summit-to-Eat'?"</p>

  <p>Our silence was properly contemptuous of this sally.</p>

  <p>"If you didn't like that you might call it 'Summit-to-Drink,'" the
  frivolous voice impenitently continued. "Then you would get all the
  Americans there too."</p>

  <p>The voice's glass having been replenished (which, I fancy, was its
  inner purpose) we became serious again.</p>

  <p>"As it is on the top of the hill," said the first lady, "there will
  probably be a view. Why not call it, for example, 'Bellevue'? 'Bellevue'
  is a charming word."</p>

  <p>"A little French, isn't it?" someone inquired.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, it's French," she admitted. "But it's all right, isn't it?
  It's quite nice French."</p>

  <p>We assured her that, for a French phrase, it was singularly free from
  impropriety.</p>

  <p>"But of course," she said, "there's an Italian equivalent, 'Bella
  Vista.' 'Bella Vista' is delightful."</p>

  <p>"I passed a 'Bella Vista' in Surbiton yesterday," said the frivolous
  voice, "and an errand-boy had done his worst with it with a very black
  lead pencil."</p>

  <p>"What could he do?" the gentle lady asked wonderingly, with big violet
  eyes distended.</p>

  <p>"It is not for me to explain," said the frivolous voice; "but the
  final vowel of the first word dissatisfied him and he substituted
  another. The capabilities of errand-boys with pencil or chalk should
  never be lost sight of when one is choosing a name for a front gate."</p>

  <p>"I am all at sea," said the lady plaintively. Then she brightened. "Is
  there no prominent landmark visible from the new house?" she asked. "It
  is so high there must be."</p>

  <p>Our hostess said that by cutting down two trees it would be possible
  to see Windsor Castle.</p>

  <p>"Oh, then, do cut them down," said the lady, "and call it 'Castle
  View.' That would be perfect."</p>

  <p>During the panic that followed I made a suggestion. "The best name for
  it," I said, "is 'Buckler's.' That is what the country people will call
  it, and so you may as well forestall them and be resigned to it. Besides,
  it's the right kind of name. It's the way most of the farms all over
  England once were named&mdash;after their owners, and where the owner was
  a man of character and force the name persisted. Call it 'Buckler's' and
  you will help everyone, from the postman to the strange guest who might
  otherwise tour the neighbourhood for miles searching for you long after
  lunch was finished."</p>

  <p>"But isn't it too practical?" the first lady asked. "There's no poetry
  in it."</p>

  <p>"No," I said, "there isn't. The poetry is in its owner. Any man who
  can stand in an open field under a July rainstorm and show another man
  where his bedroom is to be in a year's time is poet enough."</p>

<h3>ENGLAND UNBENDS.</h3>

<p class="center"><font class="sc">Reports from Spa and Shore.</font></p>

  <p><font class="sc">Scargate.</font>&mdash;This famous Yorkshire Spa is
  now in a condition of hectic activity and offers a plethora of
  attractions. A recent analysis of the waters shows that the proportion of
  sapid ovaloid particles and sulphuretted trinitrotoluene is larger than
  ever. Lieutenant Platt-Stithers' stincopated anthropoid orchestra plays
  four times daily&mdash;in the early morning and at noon for the relief of
  the water-drinkers, and in the afternoon and evening in the rotating Jazz
  Hall. Special attractions this week include cinema lectures daily on the
  domestic life of the Solomon Islanders by Mr. Nicholas Ould; a recital on
  the Bolophone on Thursday by Mr. Tertius Quodling, and, at the Grand
  Opera House, <i>Pope Joan</i> and <i>The Flip-Flappers</i>. On Saturday
  the Stridcar Golf Club will hold a series of competitions in rational
  fancy dress for the benefit of the Phonetic Spelling Association.</p>

  <p><font class="sc">Fallalmouth.</font>&mdash;Visitors to this romantic
  resort are offered a wide field of entertainment and moral uplift. The
  steamer excursions embrace trips up the lovely river Fallal to Gongor,
  famous for the prehistoric remains of the shrine of Saint Opodeldoc, and
  to beauty spots in the harbour like Glumgallion, Trehenna and Pangofflin
  Creek. There are also excursions in armed motor-char-à-bancs to Boscagel,
  Cadgerack and Flapperack. To-day visitors can view the gardens at
  Poljerrick, where many super-tropical plants, including man-eating cacti,
  are growing in the most unbridled luxuriance. There is a fine sporting
  nine-hole golf-course on the shingle strand at Grogwalloe, where the test
  of niblick play is more severe than on any links save those of the Culbin
  Sands near Nairn. Among other attractive features are the brilliant
  displays of aurora borealis over the Bay, which have been arranged at
  considerable cost by the Corporation in conjunction with the
  Meteorological Society.</p>

  <p><font class="sc">Borecambe.</font>&mdash;The demand for
  bathing-machines and tents continues to increase, though the shopkeepers
  are complaining of a decreasing spending power on the part of the
  visitors and a disinclination to pay more than a shilling a head for
  shrimps. The practice of dispensing with head-gear is also much resented
  by local outfitters, but otherwise the situation is well in hand. On
  Monday last Mr. Silas Pargeter, an old resident, caught a fine
  conger-eel, weighing fifty-six pounds, which he has presented to the
  Museum. As Borecambe is a good jumping-off ground for the Lake District
  there are daily char-à-banc excursions to the land of <font
  class="sc">Wordsworth</font> and <font class="sc">Ruskin</font>, each
  passenger being supplied with a megaphone and a pea-shooter.</p>

<h3>MY DROMEDARY.</h3>

  <p>I see by <i>The Times</i> that dromedaries are on sale at sixty-five
  pounds apiece.</p>

  <p>In these days, when commodities of all kinds are so expensive, one
  cannot afford to overlook bargains of whatever nature they may be. And it
  seems to me that a dromedary at sixty-five pounds is really rather
  cheap.</p>

  <p>For after all sixty-five pounds to-day is little more than thirty
  pounds in pre-war times. Considering their trifling cost I am surprised
  that more people do not possess dromedaries. Most of my neighbours during
  the past two years have built garages, but not one, so far as I am aware,
  has built a dromedary-drome.</p>

  <p>I think I shall buy one of these attractive pets if my pass-book
  encourages me. Cheaper than a motor-car and far more intelligent and
  responsive to human affection, a dromedary will add distinction to my
  establishment and afford pleasant occupation for my leisure. It brings no
  attendant annoyance from the Inland Revenue authorities; there are no
  tiresome registration fees or regulations as to the dimensions of a
  number-plate.</p>

  <p>As long as I can remember I have lived in a state of uncertainty as to
  whether a dromedary has two humps and a camel one, or a camel two humps
  and a dromedary one. With one of these exotic quadrupeds tethered only a
  few yards away from the kitchen door that condition of doubt need not
  exist in the future for more than a few moments. In a good light it
  should be perfectly easy to count the humps or hump. Then again a
  dromedary will come for a walk on a fine evening without involving one in
  a dog-fight. It will provide quiet yet healthful exercise for the two
  children. If it turns out that the type possesses two humps it will be
  able to convey Edgar and Marigold at one and the same time, thus saving
  delay and inconvenience.</p>

  <p>It will be a protection to the house. When we have gone to bed the
  faithful creature will lie on guard in the hall, and no amount of
  poisoned liver thrust through the letter-box will assuage its ferocity or
  weaken its determination to protect the hearth and home of its master
  against marauders. For the dromedary is not only a strict teetotaler and
  non-smoker, but a lifelong vegetarian. Famous for its browsing
  propensities, a dromedary about the garden will save untold labour and
  expense, keeping the lawn trimmed and the hedges clipped. And indoors its
  height will serve me admirably in enabling me, while seated on its hump
  or one of its humps, to attend in comfort to a little whitewashing job
  which will not brook further postponement.</p>

  <p>I will look at my pass-book to-morrow.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

  <p>Not every regiment has the good luck to find for chronicler one who is
  not only a distinguished soldier but a practical and experienced man of
  letters. This fortune is enjoyed by <i>The Gold Coast Regiment</i> (<font
  class="sc">Murray</font>) in securing for its historian Sir <font
  class="sc">Hugh Clifford</font>, K.C.M.G., from whose book you may obtain
  a vivid picture of a phase of the Empire's effort about which the average
  Briton has heard comparatively little. The very strenuous compaigns of
  the G.C.R., the endurance and achievements of its brave and light-hearted
  troops, and the heroism and fostering care of its officers, make an
  inspiring story. Almost for the first time one gains some real idea of
  the difficulties of the East African campaign, that prolonged tiger hunt,
  in which every advantage of mobility, of choice of ground, ambush and the
  like lay with the enemy; and over very tough physical obstacles, as, for
  example, rivers so variable that, in the author's incisive phrase, they
  "can rarely be relied upon, for very long together, either to furnish
  drinking-water or to refrain from impeding transport." It is interesting
  to note that Sir <font class="sc">Hugh</font>, while giving every credit
  to the remarkable personality of the German commander, entirely
  demolishes the theory, so grateful to our sentimentalists, that the
  absence of surrenders on the part of the enemy's black troops was due to
  any devotion to <font class="sc">Von Lettow-Vorbeck</font> as leader; the
  explanation being the characteristic German dodge of creating from the
  natives a military caste so highly privileged, and consequently unpopular
  with their fellows, that surrender, involving return to native civilian
  life, became a practical impossibility.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Much the best part, and a good best, of <i>Sir Harry</i> (<font
  class="sc">Collins</font>) is the opening, which is not only delightful
  in itself but contains almost the sole example of a chapter-long letter
  (of the kind usually so unconvincing in fiction) in which I have found it
  possible to believe as being actually written by one character to
  another. The explanation of which is that this one is supposed to be sent
  to his wife by the new <i>Vicar of Royd</i>, himself a successful
  novelist, on a visit of inspection to his future parish. The efforts of
  <i>Mrs. Grant</i>, at home, to disentangle essential facts from the
  complications of the literary manner form as pleasant and human an
  introduction to a story as any I remember. The story itself is one highly
  characteristic of its author, Mr. <font class="sc">Archibald
  Marshall</font>, both in charm and truth to life, as also in one minor
  drawback, of which I have taken occasion to speak before. Nothing could
  be better done than the picture of the household at Royd Castle, the boy
  owner, <i>Sir Harry</i>, sheltered by the almost too-encompassing care of
  the three elder inmates, mother, grandmother and tutor. When the
  fictionally inevitable happens and an Eve breaks into this protected Eden
  there follow some boy-and-girl love-scenes that may perhaps remind
  you&mdash;and what praise could be higher?&mdash;of the collapse of
  another system on the meeting of <i>Richard</i> and <i>Lucy</i>. I will
  not anticipate the end of a sympathetically told story, which I myself
  should have enjoyed even more but for Mr. <font
  class="sc">Marshall's</font> habit (hinted at above) of following real
  life somewhat too closely in the matter of non-progressive discussion.
  How I should like him to lay his next scene in a community of
  Trappists!</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>The Haunted Bookshop</i> (<font class="sc">Chapman and Hall</font>)
  is a daring, perhaps too daring, mixture of a browse in a second-hand
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg 80]</span>
  bookshop and a breathless bustle among international criminals. To
  estimate the accuracy of its technical details the critic must be a
  secret service specialist, the mustiest of bookworms and a highly-trained
  expert in the science and language of the American advertising business.
  Speaking as a general practitioner, I like Mr. <font
  class="sc">Christopher Morley</font> best when he is being
  cinematographic; he hits a very happy mean with his spies and his
  sleuths, giving a nice proportion of skill and error, failure and
  success, to both. There is a strong love-interest which will be made much
  of and probably spoilt by the purchasers of the film-rights; and, though
  strong men will doubtless applaud hoarsely and women will weep copiously,
  as the bomb in the bookshop throws the young lovers into each other's
  arms, I feel that the book gives a more attractive portrait of <i>Titania
  Chapman</i>, the plutocrat's daughter, than ever can be materialised in
  the film-man's "close-up." I am afraid that Mr. <font
  class="sc">Morley</font> will not thank me for praising his brisk
  melodrama at the cost of his ramblings in literature. But, if he has the
  knowledge, he lacks the fragrance; not to put too fine a point on it, he
  is long-winded and tends to bore in his disquisitions upon books and
  bookishness; which is no proper material for a novelist. The story is all
  about America and is thoroughly American; inevitably therefore there is
  some ambitious word-coining. The only novelty which sticks in my memory
  and earns my gratitude is the title for the female Bolshevik, to wit,
  Bolshevixen.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Wayward and capricious heroines who marry young are entitled, I think,
  to a certain amount of introspective treatment by their authors. Without
  some knowledge of their mental working it is not very easy for the reader
  to have patience with them. I was introduced to <i>Anne</i> (<font
  class="sc">Heinemann</font>) when she was fifteen, and in the act of
  snatching a loaf of bread from a baker's cart and running away with it
  merely to annoy the baker; and, as she had large blue eyes and two young
  men as self-appointed guardians, I was prepared for a certain amount of
  heart trouble later on. One of these heroes she married at the age of
  seventeen, and, after various innocent but compromising vagaries
  (including a flight to Paris after the death of her son in order to study
  art), she followed the other one, still innocently, to Ireland, because
  he had been in prison and she was sorry for him. Both these guardians
  discharged their duty to <i>Anne</i> at least as well as <font
  class="sc">Olga Hartley</font>, who chronicles but does not explain; and
  this is a pity, for with a rather different treatment she might have made
  her heroine a very likeable person. Looked at from another point of view,
  <i>Anne</i> may be taken as a mild piece of propaganda against divorce. I
  am glad it didn't come to that, of course, but I do feel that a
  cross-examining K.C. would have discovered a good deal more about Anne's
  soul for me than I learnt from the writer of her story.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>John Fitzhenry</i> (<font class="sc">Mills and Boon</font>) is one
  of those pleasant stories about people who live in big country houses, a
  subject that seems to have a particular attraction for the large and
  ungrudging public which lives in villas. We have already several
  novelists who tell them very ably, and I feel that some one among them
  has served as Miss <font class="sc">Ella MacMahon's</font> model. The
  tale deals with the affairs of a showy fickle cousin and a silent
  constant cousin who compete for the love of the same delightful if rather
  nebulous young woman, and moves to its <i>dénouement</i>, against a
  background of the great War, which Miss <font class="sc">MacMahon</font>
  has very sensibly decided to view entirely from the home front. It
  contains some fine thinking and some bad writing (the phrase telling of
  the middle-aged smart woman who "waved her foot impatiently" gives a just
  idea of the author's occasional inability to say what she means), some
  quite extraneous incidents and some scenes very well touched in. The
  people, with a few exceptions, are of the race which inhabits this sort
  of book, and, as we have long agreed with our novelists that "the county"
  is just like that, I don't see why Miss <font class="sc">MacMahon</font>
  should be blamed for it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">Cosmo Hamilton</font> lays the scene of <i>His
  Friend and His Wife</i> (<font class="sc">Hurst and Blackett</font>) in
  the Quaker Hill Colony of Connecticut, the members of which were
  typically "nice" and took themselves very seriously. So when one of them
  brought a divorce suit against her husband there was a feeling that the
  colony's reputation had been irremediably besmirched. Mr. <font
  class="sc">Hamilton</font> can be trusted to create tense situations out
  of the indiscretions of an erring couple, but he also contrives, in spite
  of its artificial atmosphere, to make us believe in this society, though
  he tried me rather hard with a scandalmongress of the type we happily
  meet less often in life than in fiction. I hope he will not be quite so
  dental in his next book. I didn't so much mind <i>Mrs. Hopper's</i>
  teeth, which "flashed like an electric advertisement," but when he made
  two golfers also flash "triumphant teeth" I recoiled.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>The Golden Bird</i> of Miss <font class="sc">Dorothy Easton</font>
  (<font class="sc">Heinemann</font>) is indeed lucky to set out on its
  flight with a favouring pat from Mr. <font class="sc">John
  Galsworthy</font>. He asserts that these short studies of people and
  things in England and France are very well done indeed; that moreover,
  though the short sketch may look, and the bad short sketch may be, one of

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
